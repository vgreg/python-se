Examples for regression standard errors in Python with statsmodels


***IMPORTANT:*** This repository is no longer maintained. 

For time series data, I wrote a new blog post with examples using statsmodels: [https://vincent.codes.finance/posts/timeseries-standard-errors/](https://vincent.codes.finance/posts/timeseries-standard-errors/).

For panel data, I wrote a new blog post with examples using linearmodels: [https://vincent.codes.finance/posts/panel-ols-standard-errors/](https://vincent.codes.finance/posts/panel-ols-standard-errors/).
